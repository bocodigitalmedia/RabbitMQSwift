RabbitMQSwift
=============

A Swift wrapper for the RabbitMQ C-library

This is a rudimentary proof of concept for wrapping the RabbitMQ C client in Swift. It needs a lot of work, also fundamental decisions about organization.

If you are interested in using RabbitMQ in Swift please feel free to join the effort.
